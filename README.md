### done list
- we need to create a list of movies

### todo
Webpage needs to house a list of movie titles

Data needed for movie
- name
- movie rating
  - G (any age)
  - PG 13 (at least 13)
  - R (at least 18)
- first release

Need to figure out stuff for ticket
- name of movie
- time of day
- person age
- price (based on age)
  - price is less for senior (55+)
  - price is less for children (11-)
- price (based on time)
  - price is less for showings before 2pm

- we need to get user input for tickets
  - all at same time?

- we need to find the movie from the ticket info

- check age
  - if age is too low for movie, tell them they can't watch
  - otherwise, show price based on input
